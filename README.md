# Friday Night Funkin' - Vs Elliott

Lets make this bitch

## Plot shit:
Your walking along an alley when you see a poster, "Rap battle training, learn, note custom notes, extra keys and mult####ce##no##lis###on" part of the flyer has been ripped off but you can see the address. So like any normal person, girlfriend teleports you there as any mortal can do that. Elliott is doing some shit (this is where cutscene starts) and bf launches a microphone through the door. Elliott is extremely suprised to see boyfriend especially as there was a death note on it but you didn't see it as it got ripped off, so Elliott takes the poster off the wall and says "Ya know what, I'll train you, see if you can beat this", and so he sings spawning Hurt Notes and HD Notes. Elliott is impressed with your abilities stepping it up adding in Red Warning Notes and Kill Notes. At the end Elliott desides to put you against his final exam adding in Poison Notes, Health Drain Multiplier Notes and Popup notes. He includes Tabis health drain to spice it up even more. He tells you to come back next week for extra keys
